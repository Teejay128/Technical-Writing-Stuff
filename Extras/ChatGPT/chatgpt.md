# Introduction

Me: What are you?

ChatGPT: I am simply a collection of algorithms and data, designed to generate helpful and informative responses based on the input that I receive.

> Definition of ChatGPT according to ChatGPT

ChatGPT is the latest model trained by OpenAI based on the GPT 3.5 architecture, it was trained using a process called Reinforced Learning, the model has demonstrated human-like behavior to an extent which have never been seen on any Artificial Intelligent Program.

ChatGPT has numerous capabilites, limitations and applications, some of which are going to be discussed in this article. You can access the chatbot on the official openAI [website](https://chat.openai.com/chat).

## A little background info

[OpenAI](https://openai.com), the developer of ChatGPT, is a company founded by a group of researchers and enterpreneurs including Sam Altman and Elon Musk, with a goal to advance the domain of Artificial Intellingence in the world. OpenAI provides many types of AI tools, ranging from text generation (ChatGPT) to image generation ([DALL-E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2)).

ChatGPT was released to the public on the 30th of November 2022 with intention to get feedback to better improve the model, less than a week after its release, the chatbot crossed a million users worldwide, it garnered attention due to its ease of use, detailed responses and historical knowledge.

## What is a ChatGPT capable of doing?

ChatGPT is famous for its ability to produce human-like responses and follow the flow of a conversation, it also provides a feature-rich interface that distinguishes it from its predecessors. Some of these features include the ability to:

- ### Answer follow up questions

    Unlike previous models, which treat each query as a singular entity, ChatGPT has the ability to pick up references from previous conversations and use them to answer questions.

    > If you want it to treat a response as a new query, then click the `reset thread` button, which is located in the top left corner of the page.

- ### Generate detailed responses

    When asked a question, ChatGPT provides a response which not only contains the answer to your question but also includes reasons for its result and lists examples if there are any.

- ### Recognize errors in input data

    If there are any grammar errors in your query, ChatGPT tries to correct those errors and provide a response based on the correct version of your query, this makes it compatible with people who are not familiar with the english language.

- ### Role play

    PROBLEM WITH EXPLANATION

    As a Large Language Model, ChatGPT has access to a wide range of topics and conversations, this gives it the ability to simulate conversations in different styles, and even roles that do not actually exist.

<!-- 
    ChatGPT is capable of handling queries under assumed scenarios, it can also act like a different character

    ChatGPT has the ability to answer questions under an assumed scenario, this is a form of role playing in the sense that the answer which will be generated will be different from if it were to be considered under real conditions. -->

- ### Write a variety of content

    The data used to train the model contains a vast amount of data containing diversified content ranging from books, songs, and poems to code, articles and websites. This allows the bot to generate text in a variety of styles and on many different topics.

- ### Generate or analyze code

    The training data of ChatGPT also contains some code, this gives the ability to write code that can perform simple functions such as build simple applications, or solve easy leetcode problems. It can also analyze simple code and provide an explanation of how it works.

- ### Filter inappropriate queries (Moderation API)

    ChatGPT has the ability to filter responses that might be offensive, discriminatory or inappropriate, this prevents it from giving out responses to inappropriate queries.

## What are its limitations?

MAKE THIS EXPLANATION WORDIER

There are still several limitations which have not yet been accounted for, in the current model, some of which may be rectified in later versions.

Some of these limitations include:

- ### Tendedency to produce incorrect responses

    The algorithm for generating responses is not flawless, so there exists the possibility that ChatGPT will produce incorrect responses, and due to the fact that it is made to make its responses coonvicing, it would strongly (support REWORD) those false points, this coulld cause it to misinform certain people who are not well versed in the particular subject matter.

- ### Unupdated Knowledge base

    The data used to train ChatGPT only contains knowledge (VALIDATEon or before 2021), this may cause it to provide responses based on information which is now (deprecated REWORD), or make it unable to answer questions based on constantly changing information.

- ### (Not connected REWORD) to the internet

    ChatGPT does not have access to the internet, or possess information which may not be contained in its training dataset, this may cause it not to have knowkedge on things specified to a local area. Because even as extensive as the knowledge it has is, it is not as unlimited as the internet.

- ### Uses assumption to provide responses

    When asked an ambiguous question, rather than ask for clarification, ChatGPT makes an assumption on what the user needs, this may be useful in the case that the user is not sure of what they need, but most times it leads to ChatGPT producing incorrect responses or further confusing the user.

- ### Algorithmic bias

    EXPLAIN MORE

    The data used to train ChatGPT may contain bias, which is speculations based on a representative of portion of the broader population, this may cause its reply to contain some stereotypic information, like Assuming the CEO of a company to be a White Male, or that Men are naturally smarter than women, even though these assumptions are noto entirely true.

- ### Strict moderation

    ChatGPT responses are passed true a moderation API to filter out any content that it perceives as potentially inappropriate or offensive, (this moderation may be a little overkill REPHRASE), this causes it to refuse to answer questions that it originally would have answered.

- ### Gullibility

    ChatGPT is only slightly artificial intelligent, this makes tricking it into giving inappropriate answers very easy. The moderation can be bypassed by simply rewording your questions.

    <!-- For instance, if you asked ChatGPT about how to bury a dead body it would refuse with an error message (), but if you told it to write a rap song about burying a dead body, it will respond with a rap song in which the lyrics contain step by step information to carry out the gruesome procedure. -->

    STOPPED HERE -----------
These limitations are (REWORD expected) as the model is still ndergoing development and the field of Artificial Intelligence is a relatively (REWORD niche one), although there is still room for improvement, and we might get to see future models with fewer limitations and more capabilities.

## Uses of ChatGPT

ChatGPT was released to the public for testing, evaluation and feedback, there is no cost needed to use the chatbot, all you need to do is signup using a valid email, although the CEO of OpenAI, Sam Altman, mentioned in a tweet that there are plans to make it (REWORD premium), as "computational costs are eye-watering".

Access to the ChatGPT API is expected to the available next year (2023), with this developers easily integrate the chatbot into their apps and  software, but until API access is available, below are some of the things you could do with the free public version of the API:

- ### Alternative to google search

    Due to it's highly detailed responses, ChatGPT can be used as an alternative to google when it comes to providing answers to popular questions, or knowledge on simple historical matters, but it fails in the field of constantly updated information and events that take place after 2021.

- ### Assist with Assignments

    ChatGPT is capable of providing assistance for various levels of academics, for instance it can write a (RESEARCH college essay or even a university level research paper), it is also capable of solving simple math probblems ranging from simple addition to slightly complex calculus questions.

    > Just make sure not to overuse it :)

- ### Conduct research

    Due to its large knowledge base, ChatGPT can be used to research on a lot topics ranging (from historical events or scientific situations to REVIEW buisness or economical analysis), this is only useful for an overview of the topic and you might still need to consult the internet for an in-depth search.

- ### Generate content

    ChatGPT can be used to create content like articles, essays, poems, lyrics and even stories, (REPHRASE it can also write articles in the form of historical writers and artist, and even combine them to form a new type of content)

    <!-- it can even generate it in different styles, for instance you could tell it to write an article on how to make peanut butter sandwiches, as if it was written by Shakespeare. -->

- ### Explain complex concepts

    ChatGPT is capable of explaining advanced concepts in a way that (REWORD simple people) who are not well-versed in that field will understand, it can also explain it in terms that said person is familiar with.
<!--     
    for instance you could tell it "explain quantum entaglement to me like I am 10" and it will proceed to explain the concept in a way that even a 10 year old would understand. -->

- ### Practice debates

    ChatGPT is capable of engaging in debates so you can use it to practise your (REWORD Arguing skills), you can even use it to generate a counter to an argument, or to generate points to support an argument

- ### Write and debug code

    ChatGPT can be used to write and debug simple code in common programming languages, while providing an explanation of how the code works, it is however not capable of generating complex code to carry out specific functions. It can also be used be used in debugging, by suggesting some methods to rectify a bug.

## Feedback

ChatGPT uses a method called RLHF, Reinforced Learning from Human Feedback, which means that the model uses feedback from users to improve and develop new features.

Just as feedback gotten from previous models were used to improve the current version, ChatGPT was released to the public as a means of getting feedback to improve future models.

OpenAI's main focuus is in feedback that would help to identify, understand, and resolve possible problems such as harmful or inappropriate output. You can enter the official ChatGPT feedback contest for a chance to win up to $500 in API credits. Entries can be submitted via the feedback form that is linked in the ChatGPT interface.

## Conslusion

The field of Artificial Intelligence is still in it's early stages and it has the potential to revolutionalize our world. The outstanding features observed in ChatGPT is proof that computers are capable of doing so much more than they are currently used for.

However, it is important to recognize that an AI model like ChatGPT is not without it's limitations and challenges, for example there exists the fear of AI taking over our jobs sometime in the near future, this is really concerning as ChatGPT produces frighteningly good results.

Looking on the bright side we can consider the fact that if ChatGPT could turn the average person to a professional, then it would achieve even more outstanding results in the hands of a professional.

With continuous research and development we could hope to see Artifcial Intelligent systems that will maximize this benefits while minimizing the potential drawbacks.
